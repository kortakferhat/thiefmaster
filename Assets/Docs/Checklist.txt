- [ ]  Manually create a simple map (3–5 nodes)
- [ ]  Draw nodes in scene using Gizmos
- [ ]  Draw edges between nodes using Gizmos

### 🎮 B. Player Movement (Day 1–2)

- [ ]  Show enemy node in red (Gizmos)
- [ ]  Press "R" to reload scene instantly

---

### 👁️ D. Enemy & Vision (Day 3)

- [ ]  Add facing direction to enemy
- [ ]  Trace vision range along edges (e.g., 2–3 nodes ahead)
- [ ]  Highlight vision nodes using Gizmos
- [ ]  Trigger loss if player enters visible node
- [ ]  Log detection result: "Player seen by enemy at Node X"

---

### 🎯 E. Goal & Loss Conditions (Day 3)

### 🧪 H. Test Map & Review (Day 5–6)

- [ ]  Create at least two sample levels:
    - [ ]  One basic goal-reaching puzzle
    - [ ]  One vision-loss test scenario
- [ ]  Confirm all mechanics work in order
- [ ]  Allow restart with “R” on any state

---

### 🧠 BONUS (Optional – Day 7+)

- [ ]  Add basic UI for "You Win / You Lose"
- [ ]  Setup simple level progression or next button
